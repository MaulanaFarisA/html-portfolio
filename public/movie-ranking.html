<hr />
<h3>The Truman Show</h3>
<p>Have you ever think that we live in a simulation? This is the movie you're looking for!</p>
<h3>Gravity Falls</h3>
<p>It's actually a cartoon, BUT Gravity falls will always be special in my heart.</p>
<h3>Dr Strange</h3>
<p>Well.. this is my favourite superhero in the MCU. I like "psychic" thingys.</p>
